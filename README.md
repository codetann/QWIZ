# QWIZ App

This project was created with React, React Router, Firebase, Firestore, and Styled Components

### `About`

This is a quiz application that lets users select a category, difficalty, and nickname to save their scores.

The database is hosted on firebase.

I have always wanted to create a quiz application with different categories and let users save their scores.
I finally got around to it and it was a learning experience for sure. The code could use some refactoring but
for the time being, it works. Yay!
